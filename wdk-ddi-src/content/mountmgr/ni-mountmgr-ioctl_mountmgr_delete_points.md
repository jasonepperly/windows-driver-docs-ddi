# IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_DELETE_POINTS IOCTL



## -description
This IOCTL is identical in input and output to <a href="..\mountmgr\ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_query_points.md">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_QUERY_POINTS</a>. The difference is that IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_DELETE_POINTS has the side effect of deleting the symbolic links and the mount manager database entries for the triples returned.

If the input to this IOCTL is ("\DosDevices\X:", <b>NULL</b>, <b>NULL</b>) where X is the current drive letter for the volume indicated in the input triple, the mount manager adds a special entry to its database indicating that the client does not require a drive letter. On subsequent reboots, the mount manager will not assign a default drive letter to the volume.
